I like NPR, so I made some scripts to download my favorite programs from
NPR. For now, I have something that downloads `Fresh
Air <http://www.npr.org/programs/fresh-air/>`__ and `Wait Wait..Donâ€™t
Tell Me <http://www.npr.org/programs/wait-wait-dont-tell-me/>`__. This
package can probably, straightforwardly be extended to other NPR and PRI
programs.
