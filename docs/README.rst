I like NPR, so I made some scripts to download my favorite programs from
NPR. For now, I have something that downloads `Fresh
Air <http://www.npr.org/programs/fresh-air/>`__, `Wait Wait..Donâ€™t Tell
Me <http://www.npr.org/programs/wait-wait-dont-tell-me/>`__, and `This
American Life <http://www.thisamericanlife.org/>`__. This package can
probably, straightforwardly be extended to other NPR and PRI programs.

Although this project started off as a way to download these three
programs, I have expanded it to include a grab bag of altogether
different types of functionalities. What remains the same? This
distribution consists mainly of executable python scripts.
