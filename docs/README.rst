I like NPR, so I made some scripts to download my favorite programs from
NPR. For now, I have something that downloads `Fresh
Air <http://www.npr.org/programs/fresh-air/>`__, `Wait Wait..Don’t Tell
Me <http://www.npr.org/programs/wait-wait-dont-tell-me/>`__, and `This
American Life <http://www.thisamericanlife.org/>`__. This package can
probably, straightforwardly be extended to other NPR and PRI programs.

Although this project started off as a way to download these three
programs, I have expanded it to include a grab bag of altogether
different types of functionalities. What remains the same? This
distribution consists mainly of executable python scripts.

I organize this document into the following sections: Core Functionality
[sec:core\_functionality], New Functionality [sec:new\_functionality],
Graphics Functionality (in folders “gui” and
“gui2”)[sec:graphics\_functionality], and a small section on
Oldstuff[sec:oldstuff]
