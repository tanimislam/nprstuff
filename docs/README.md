I like NPR, so I made some scripts to download my favorite programs from
NPR. For now, I have something that downloads [Fresh
Air](http://www.npr.org/programs/fresh-air/), [Wait Wait..Don’t Tell
Me](http://www.npr.org/programs/wait-wait-dont-tell-me/), and [This
American Life](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/). This package can
probably, straightforwardly be extended to other NPR and PRI programs.

Although this project started off as a way to download these three
programs, I have expanded it to include a grab bag of altogether
different types of functionalities. What remains the same? This
distribution consists mainly of executable python scripts.

I organize this document into the following sections: Core Functionality
\[sec:core\_functionality\], New Functionality
\[sec:new\_functionality\], Graphics Functionality (in folders “gui” and
“gui2”)\[sec:graphics\_functionality\], and a small section on
Oldstuff\[sec:oldstuff\]

New Functionality {#sec:new_functionality}

Graphics Functionality {#sec:graphics_functionality}
