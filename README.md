===========

I like NPR, so I made some scripts to download my favorite programs
from NPR. For now, I have something that downloads `Fresh Air` and `Wait Wait..Don't Tell Me`. This package can probably, straightforwardly be
extended to other NPR and PRI programs.

External hyperlinks like Python_..._Python: http://www.python.org. And more things like that.

..`Wait Wait..Don't Tell Me`: http://www.npr.org/programs/wait-wait-dont-tell-me/
