I like NPR, so I made some scripts to download my favorite programs
from NPR. For now, I have something that downloads `Fresh Air <http://www.npr.org/programs/fresh-air/>`_ and `Wait Wait..Don't Tell Me <http://www.npr.org/programs/wait-wait-dont-tell-me/>`_. This package can probably, straightforwardly be extended to other NPR and PRI programs.
